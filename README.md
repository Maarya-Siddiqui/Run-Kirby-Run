# Run-Kirby-Run-
Side-scrolling platformer game, created using Pygame. 

# Objective
Kirby is on a special mission and needs your help getting to his castle safely! You must collect coins, dodge the evil shells, travel around poisonous phiranna plants, jump over deadly gorges and make it home alive. Watch out for the evil creatures, or you'll lose a life. Falling into a gorge, being eaten by a phiranna plant or running into a shell will be game over for Kirby. But don't fret! Collect shooting stars to level up and gain another life. 

Think you're up for the challenge?
